    "    The magnitude of the fluctuations depends on the system size (larger fluctuations\n",
    "    for smaller systems) and on how close are to the Curie temperature.\n",
    "    We note, in particular, that one can obtain the magnetic susceptibility from the fluctuations\n",
    "    of the magnetization. The magnetic susceptibility will diverge for $T=T_c$ (i.e.,\n",
