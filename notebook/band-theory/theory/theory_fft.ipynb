    "The wavefunction of the system can be represented in multiple basis sets. For material systems with periodic boundary conditions, a plane-wave basis set is frequently chosen, due to its periodic nature and numerical efficiency as discussed below. This strategy is adopted by many popular DFT packages in solid-state physics, including e.g. [ABINIT](https://www.abinit.org), [CASTEP](http://www.castep.org), [Quantum ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org), and [VASP](https://www.vasp.at)."

    "The general form of a plane wave is:\n",
    "$$ P(\\mathbf{r}) = P_0 e^{i\\mathbf{q}\\cdot \\mathbf{r}}.$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "The name \"plane wave\" originates from the fact that the wavefront (where the wave assumes the same value) is a plane perpendicular to the propagation direction $\\mathbf{q}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In solid-state physics, where one typically studies periodic crystalline solids, Bloch's theorem tells us that\n",
    "any wavefunction can be written as $\\psi_{n\\mathbf{k}}(r) = u_{n\\mathbf{k}}(r) e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot \\mathbf{r}}$,\n",
    "where $u_{n\\mathbf{k}}(r)$ is a function with the same periodicity of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this function is periodic, we can then use a plane-wave basis set to represent $u_{n\\mathbf{k}}(r)$:\n",
    "$$ u_{n\\mathbf{k}}(r) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{G}} c_i(\\mathbf G) e^{i\\mathbf{G\\cdot r}}$$\n",
    "where the sum is over all reciprocal lattice vectors $\\mathbf G$.\n",
    "Similarly, the charge density (that also has the periodicity of the system) is represented in a plane-wave basis set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of this basis set is the possibility to use fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms to convert between the reciprocal-space representation (the coefficient of the plane waves) and the real-space representation of the wavefunctions on a grid. This is appealing because the operation of the potential on $\\psi$ is very simple in real space (since for local potentials it is simply an element-wise multiplication), while it is very efficient to compute the operation of the kinetic operator in reciprocal space, where the second derivative also becomes simply an element-wise multiplication. One can then pass between the two representations using FFTs, when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the number of plane waves (or, equivalently, of $\\mathbf G$ vectors) determines the size of the numerical problem to solve, it is important to find a balance between using enough plane waves to accurately represent the plane waves, but at the same time not too many, to avoid to make an overly expensive calculation.\n",
    "This notebook helps in visualizing the effect of the basis set size on the functions that we want to represent."

    "In real space, a Fourier series is a linear combination of cosine and sine functions used to represent a smooth periodic function defined in a certain range.\n",

    "Thus, the Fourier series is essentially the representation of a function using an infinite basis set composed of trigonometric functions. \n",
